# premierleague-ml-model
A final group project for my graduate machine learning course. For the project, our group predicted betting odds (specifically home/away team winning and over/under) for English Premier League matches. We created and tested different types of machine models–linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests–and compared the results based on each model's accuracy and usefulness.

The full group was myself, Evan Gagne, Maame Yaa Afaribea Martinson, and Suryakala Venkatakrishnan (if any of you find this, let me know and I'll be sure to properly give you credit). Dataset is from user IvanRamosDataTech on Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaxianazarenka/premier-league).
